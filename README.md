This is my hello world repository

I'm a coder-wannabe who just has too many other things he wants to work on in addition to, or instead of, learning and using code. So unless I miraculously change my ways, I'll just continue to be a coder-wannabe.

Have poked at code many times over the years starting with Fortran on punch cards. Don't ever drop a stack of punch cards. But we used to crash the MTU mainframe by running petrochemical flow simulations in the 1970s, so at one point my coding did have a lot of impact.

Had lots of fun coding on an Apple IIgs in the late 80s, early 90s, mainly Apple BASIC and Pascal. I also remember using the Internet in 1994 and manually building the stack to go online and do early web stuff. And a very small group of us learned to use an email program -- by crashing the UW Stevens Point mail server.

Hmmmm...seems to be a common theme.

Other dabbling with coding ensued, with the most recent being writing microcontroller code for Arduino (see http://humboldtmcu.blogspot.com/).

But I've never had a job or an intensely-pursued leisure activity that caused me to get skilled at coding.

If I do become halfway skilled at coding, it will probably be with either Python or microcontroller coding using the Arduino platform or a branch of that.

Update: 31 Oct 2015 --- I'm working on the Digital Ocean Hacktoberfest promo, but am only mildly acquainted with the pull request process. This update is being entered as an attempt to generate a fourth pull request.
